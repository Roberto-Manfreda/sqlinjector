# sqlinjector
A Mozilla Firefox extension to inject sql payloads on every "input" tags.
This program is not intended to offend anyone. I's an utility for white hats and penetration testers while manually looking for SQL vulnerabilities.

## How to debug
- Digit about:debugging in mozilla search  
- Enable add-on debugging  
- Add one of the files of the sqlinjector folder
