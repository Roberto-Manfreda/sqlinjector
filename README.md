# sqlinjector
A Mozilla Firefox extension to inject sql payloads on every "input" tags.  
This program is not intended to offend anyone and it was not designed to conduct malicious actions.
It's an utility for white hat hackers and professional penetration testers.
It is useful for those who carry out sql injection manually to test vulnerable input fields.  
By enabling the extension on any website, a window will be shown from which it will be possible to select the payload to be injected.  
I hope you like it and find it useful.  
  
Momentarily the extension is not officially available, but you can use it thanks to the extensions debug feature provided by Mozilla Firefox team.  

Feel free to clone the project and modify it as you want.
