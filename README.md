# sqlinjector
A Mozilla Firefox extension to inject SQL payloads on every "input" tags.  
This program is not intended to offend anyone and it was not designed to conduct malicious actions.
It's an utility for white hat hackers and professional penetration testers.
It is useful for those who carry out SQLI manually to test vulnerable input fields.  
Enable the extensino, long-click on any input field then a window will be shown from which it will be possible to select
the payload to inject.  
I hope you like it and find it useful.  
  
Momentarily the extension is not officially available, but you can use it thanks to the extensions debug 
feature provided by Mozilla Firefox team.
